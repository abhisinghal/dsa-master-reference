# Sliding Window — Jump Game VI

*[↗ LeetCode: Jump Game VI](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vi/)* · <span class="diff diff-m">Medium</span> · [pattern chapter →](/patterns/sliding-window)

**The one thing that changes vs the flagship for this pattern:** the deque holds the best `dp` value reachable within the jump range; front = best score to jump from

## The pattern this problem belongs to

This variation of Sliding Window shares the flagship's skeleton — see the pattern's canonical multi-approach walkthrough for the full brute-force → optimized ladder, then apply the tweak above.

- [→ Flagship problem for Sliding Window](/problems/) — see the multi-approach walkthrough
- [→ Pattern chapter (theory + all variations in context)](/patterns/sliding-window) — includes this problem's approach + code + trace + traps

## Solution sketch

The pattern chapter's [Sliding Window](/patterns/sliding-window) walks the brute → optimized ladder for this problem inline; a dedicated multi-approach page is planned. In the meantime:

1. **Read the pattern chapter's `Jump Game VI` section** — brute force, Java code, and Execution Trace are already there.
2. **Read the flagship problem's multi-approach walkthrough** — the *shape* of the reasoning is identical.
3. **Apply the tweak above** — that's what distinguishes this variation.
